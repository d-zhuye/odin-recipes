            <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Air fryer pork belly offers a modern take on babi guling, the famous Balinese roast pork. An air fryer provides a similarly crispy and flavorful pork with significantly less effort and time.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork Belly with Skin Included</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Shallots</li>
            <li>Tumeric Powder</li>
            <li>Coriander Powder</li>
            <lu>Lemongrass Stalks</lu>
            <li>Ground Coriander</li>
            <li>Kaffir Lime Leaves</li>
            <li>Cumin Powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Spice Paste:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel and chop the fresh turmeric, shallots, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass.</li>
                    <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the fresh turmeric, birdseye chilies, shallots, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass. Blend until a smooth paste forms.</li>
                    <li>In a small pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the black peppercorns and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute).</li>
                    <li>Add the spice paste to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the paste is fragrant and the oil starts to separate. Stir in the ground coriander, kaffir lime leaves, and curry leaves. Continue cooking for another 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pork Belly:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse the pork belly and pat it dry with paper towels. Score the skin in a crisscross pattern if not pre-scored.</li>
                    <li>Rub the pork belly all over with salt and ground turmeric. Allow it to sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Pork Belly:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rub the cooled spice paste evenly over the pork belly, making sure to get it into the scored skin. For best results, marinate the pork belly in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for more intense flavor.</li>                 
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Air Fryer:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360°F (180°C) for about 5 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pork Belly:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the marinated pork belly in the air fryer basket, skin side up. If the pork belly is too large, cut it into smaller pieces to fit.</li>
                    <li>Air fry at 360°F (180°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and the internal temperature reaches at least 145°F (63°C). You may need to adjust the time depending on the thickness of the pork belly and desired crispiness.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Check Crispiness:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the skin is not as crispy as desired, increase the temperature to 400°F (200°C) and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes, checking frequently to avoid burning.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Rest and Slice:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once cooked, remove the pork belly from the air fryer and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Slice the pork belly into pieces and serve with your favorite side dishes.</li>
                </ol>
        </ol>
